# README for Realizing High-Level Concepts through Implementation in Java

## Overview
This project aims to realize a high-level conceptual framework in code form. It begins with formulating clear and simple definitions of abstract ethical concepts, distills these ideas into a mathematical formula, and then translates that formula into working Java code.

 Chosen Concept: Deciding upon Good and Evil

The project models the ethical evaluation process by defining "good" as actions where benefits outweigh costs, and "evil" where costs prevail. It incorporates philosophical refinements, such as deontological safeguards that impose strict moral limits and methods to remove hindsight bias in decision-making.

## Features

- Implements a baseline ethical calculus formula: E = A / C
  for efficiency of actions.
- Modular aggregation of costs into multiple components (operational, opportunity, signal, delayed, and risk costs).
- Deontological warning signals represented as infinite costs to forbid morally impermissible actions.
- Hindsight bias removal by evaluating decisions based only on information available at the time.
- Code structure supports extension towards AI ethics and impartial decision analysis.
